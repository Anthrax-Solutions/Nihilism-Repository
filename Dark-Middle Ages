Castles/Resource Pools/Siege Engines/NPCs

Castles:
-Menu for castle/s with tab for upgrades, tab for resources held and tab for crafting
-Can enter and walk around, if Throne Room is held by enemy for a minute (not disputed but held) then castle control shifts
-Upgradable, start with Basic Blacksmith, basic Siegemaster, basic Village, basic Barracks
-Basic Blacksmith=Leather armor,Iron weapons > Advanced Blacksmith=Chain Armour, better leather/Improved Iron weps
 > Master Blacksmith=Improved leather/chain, Plate armour, Steel weapons
-Basic Village=x resources, adventure supplies in exchange for resources, Advanced=Market, Master=x*1.5
-Basic Siegemaster, Upgrades just unlock new ones, improve old available siege weapons and defenses

Resource Pools:
-Menu for defenses
-Stone
-Ore
-Wood
-Food
-Druids provide passive boosts as long as they're 'protected' by finder, other parties' attacks destroy this resource
-Stonehenge provides a random permanent bonus each time a team captures it, so it's in the best interest to capture and then
 hold it for as long as you can.

Siege Engines:
-Hotkey characters and siege engines to numbers, so that when character is in an engine or operating it, their hotkey 
 selects the siege engine and allows you to assign a target.
-Menu for characters which allows a formation to be chosen based on position of currently selected character

-Engines Lvl 1-
Battering Ram

-Engines Lvl 2-
Trebuchet


NPCs:
-Resource type boosts production of and defense of resource pool they're assigned to based on level
-Combat type improves attack/defense based on level
-Builder type improves strength of siege engines or strength of siege defenses they're assigned to
-Spy type allows temporary invisibility of NPC or increased critical chance or ability to kill and impersonate other NPCs
-Carer/Healer type allows better, constant healing duties of self and allies
-Level up automatically with notification, based on deeds while accompanying you or certain assignable deeds, as well as 
 bringing them out with your main character and fighting wild animals.
-Base loadout for each NPC based on role, otherwise this can be changed through menu
-Death means that a new NPC is waiting for you at closest castle

Scripting of Troops:
-Troop Menu (Combines siege weapons/defenses as well as individual troops)
-Allows deployment through use of 'map' which shows explored areas Starcraft-style

-Selection of area/target creates a rough path to destination which displays on map, a line with perhap five to ten
'toggles', which are moved and through which the path is created sequentially, ie the path continues from one point to 
another

>If two groups detect each other then they enter into combat, excepting any troops ordered not to do so
>If one detects another first and are to engage any enemies, And they get within x distance without detection, they gain
combat advantage: Perhaps a surprise round of double damage for each troop, or only ranged troops
>Otherwise, attack happens with regards to speed.
>Melee troops always at front, Range determines 'battlegrid' position (Swordsmen or spearmen)
>If encounter enemy, 'Attack'
>Attack will calculate distance between troops, troops will either move closer to match their attack range or be able to
and thus attack
>Movement determined by speed, round per round basis for AI?
>Essentially, each turn check if in range, if yes attack, if no pathfind to closest enemy, move speed along path

Barracks Troops:
1/2 metre per second = 1 Spd point
With 900 seconds, I'm setting the based speed for any troop/siege weapons at 4-5 metres per second, so there'll be some
departing from reality, but oh well
