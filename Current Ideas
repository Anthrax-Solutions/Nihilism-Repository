Game Mechanics Assumed:

These are all very basic and subject to so much change I just need a vague idea to base the skill progression off of.
<-- Feel free to change whatever or let me know what you think and I'll change it myself -->

Trackers:
R(esources), C(ombat), B(uilder), S(py), CA(rer)
10 natural resources (stone/guano/wood/berries) collected = 1 point R
1 creature killed = 1 point C
10 damage dealt = 1 point C
30 items crafted = 1 point B
2 traps/explosives placed = 1 point S
2 traps made = 1 point S

S = Able to temporarily become invisible OR able to deal 3x sneak attack damage
CA = Passive 2hp/regen per second and 1 hp/regen per second for 10 seconds per bandage use
