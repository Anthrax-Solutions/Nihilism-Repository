Outline:

A sandbox server based survival game, in a style that pays homage to Minecraft and Rust.


Feature Ideas:

1. Expansive Tech Tree, passing through Ages, i.e. Stone Age tools to current timed gear and equipment.
>Stone Age: Combat/Food/Knowledge/Social
            Combat: Fists I/II/III (I is given at beginning)
                    Rocks I/II/III (Requires Tools I from Knowledge)
                    Sling I/II/III (Requires Tools II from Knowledge)
                    Wooden Spears I/II/III (Requires Tools III from Knowledge)
                    Stone Spears I/II/III (Requires Wooden Spears II/
            
            Food:   Water (Let's pretend prehistoric water's the tiniest bit nutritious from all the evolving critters?)
                    Berries (Requires Nutrition I)
                    Meat (Requires Nutrition II)
                    Cooked Meat (Requires Nutrition III)
            
            Knowledge: Tools I/II/III/IV
                       Nutrition I/II/III/IV
                       Hunter I/II/III/IV - Run Better/Sneak/Camouflage in Dirt, Hidden from NPCs when not moving/
                                            Hidden from Wild Animals
2. Easy building system, with various materials, to allow for walls/housing/misc. buildings.
>Perhaps the standard craft table/place completed item? Farsky's base building wasn't too bad, I suspect it's similar
in Rust.
3. Crafting system based around proficiency, blueprints are hidden until a competent level is reached.
4. Persistent servers with player interaction set on open, fixed map.
5. Environment styles and clearly defined sectors of map, as placeholders.
>Only first person view to make it clear you're a person not just an overlord with a body?
6. Automated Mining and Crafting, as an end-game option.
7. Possibility of player built cities and structures.
8. Permadeath?
9. NPC creation and ownership.
>Houses: Idea of families so that NPC's sleep/frequent the same home, homes could house x people and boost efficiency of
NPCs, who would routinely use them having been assigned to them>> Players would have to strike at certain times depending on
which NPC they controlled.
>Simple control, walk up and 'talk' to NPC or select through crowd--> Naming identification: On Chat- (NPCname): [COMMAND]
>NPC Stats based on same as player stats, but more likely to specialise in tasks--> Less combative experience unless warring
nation--> Means flood of NPC's can't be weaponised (Perhaps NPC 'groups' for combat system, randomly put together unless
you select otherwise, and then randomly clashed against other player's NPC groups or structures or whatever is selected)
10. Hacking/Mind Control of said NPC's.
>Exists in all eras, ranging from fire mysticism to voodoo dolls to brain-washing.
>Loyalty/Respect contributes to likelihood of negated attempt, successive failed attempts get harder till no chance.
11. Character personalization/customization.
