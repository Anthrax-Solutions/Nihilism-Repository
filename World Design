Scale I'm currently basing on the idea that the max speed will be 35 or 30 kmph, minimum speed being 15 or 20 kmph and the
world being based on 25 as an average run speed, so that 6.25km's the technical median for width/breadth.

>Base area or volcano complex spawned first
>Dummy caves into which creatures cannot/find it hard to enter spawned, at least 36, has opening into what appears to be
large hill/mountain or underground.
>Players spawn last at least 2 km away from volcano/underground complex entrance/s



Tree clusters of 1-7 can be placed first. Berry bushes happen in 2-3 clusters of 1-3, 3-5 and along with 
anywhere between 2-5 saplings of these happening within a 250m radius, with Tree Clusters being randomly placed and a 
maximum of 100 trees existing at any time. The check occurs after each cluster is generated, so at most we end up with 106 
trees, further, each time the check is made, the system moves to the next randomly selected point at least 500m away from 
the last generated tree cluster and has a 20% chance of spawning a tree cluster. The MINIMUM number of trees is 40.
berry bushes will be generated next and capped at 20 clusters with a 10% chance to spawn, so that we can potentially have 
tree clusters without berry clusters. Sapling clusters capped at 50, same reason as berry cluster cap apart from 
limiting resources.

>Large tree cluster spawned, Tree number checked, if >= limit then stop
>Berry bush clusters spawned, Berry cluster number checked, if >= limit then stop
>Saplings spawned, Sapling cluster number checked, if >= limit then stop

Large rock piles are spawned first randomly in clusters of 3-6. 1-5 clusters of 2-3 small rock piles happen within 100m of
the large rock pile spawned last. Maximum number of large rock-piles is 100, so 105 is the upper limit, minimum is 60 
large rock piles. Each time the check is made the system moves to a randomly selected point at least 500m away.

>Large rock pile cluster spawned, large rock pile number checked if >= limit then stop
>Small rock pile clusters spawned, small rock pile number checked if >= limit then stop

Creatures could be centred around nest areas, with a cluster of 1-10 nests in each of 8/9 2kmx2km areas, 9th being the 
area where the base/volcano is located within. Creatures spawned from those nests wandering within that area only unless 
chasing a player. Each cluster has a 20% chances to be a dodo nest. Each nest has a 60% chance to spawn an adult and an 80% 
chance each to spawn anywhere from 1-3 baby dinosaurs. Dodo nests each spawn anywhere from 1-3 dodos, same movement 
restrictions as adult dinosaurs--> Can pursue up to 500m out of area limit, while babies only follow up to 100m.
Maximum limit of 5 of the nest clusters being dinosaur nests.
